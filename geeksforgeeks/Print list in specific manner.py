# Python program to print first half in 
# ascending order and the second half
# in descending order


# function to print half of the array in 
# ascending order and the other half in 
# descending order
def printOrder(arr, n):
    # sorting the array
    arr.sort()

    # order

    # order
    j = n - 1
    while j >= n / 2:
        print (arr[j]),
        j = j - 1
